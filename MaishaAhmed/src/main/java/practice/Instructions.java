    /*
    Before starting this exercise:
     EACH STUDENT WILL MAKE A SEPARATE BRANCH BEARING HIS/HER'S NAME
    From inside the branch:
     Each student will make a module bearing his/her name.
     Each student will also add packages, classes, amd files to his/her's hearts content.
    The object of this exercise will be to practice git push and git pull commands.
    We will stagger the git push and pulls so teamwork will be tested.
    This may or may not end up a hot mess. But it will be a glorious hot mess.
    GOOD LUCK!
